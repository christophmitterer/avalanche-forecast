# avalanche-forecast
Avalance Forecast is a Action for the Google Assistant that gets the latest data from the Avalanche Warning Services Tyrol - South Tyrol - Trentino.

## project description
[https://tkupek.eu/avalanche-report/](https://tkupek.eu/avalanche-report/)

## TODO
- the localization is currently only an approximation, we need an exact localization via google geocoding api + calculation what observation applies via geo polygons
https://avalanche.report/albina_files/2019-04-12/fd_regions.json
https://github.com/mikolalysenko/robust-point-in-polygon

- we need to check if there is an afternoon report and mention that

- improve date output like this: Friday, April 12th
