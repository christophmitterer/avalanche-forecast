            'DANGER_LEVEL_INTRO': 'The avalanche danger is evaluated with the five-levelled European avalanche danger scale. The levels are described by three different parameters: Probability of avalanche release, distribution of hazardous sites as well as size and frequency of expected avalanches.',
            'DANGER_LEVEL': 'The danger level always applies to a region with an area of larger than 100 kmÂ² and not to a specific individual slope. The avalanche danger described is always a forecast with uncertainties. It should always be checked on site. Ask me for a specific danger level to learn more.',

            'DANGER_LEVEL_4': 'Natural and often very large avalanches are likely. Avalanches can easily be triggered on many steep slopes. Remote triggering is typical. Whumpf sounds and shooting cracks occur frequently. Recommendations for backcountry recreationists: Stay on moderately steep terrain. Watch out below run out zones of large avalanches. Inexperienced persons should remain on open ski runs and trails. Forecast only on a few days throughout the winter.',

Avalanches can easily be triggered, particularly on steep slopes with the aspect and elevation indicated on avalanche.report. Natural avalanches and remote triggering may occur. The most critical situation for backcountry recreationists. Use terrain effecently and select best possible route and with minimal exposure. Avoid very steep slopes with the aspect and elevation indicated on avalanche.report. Inexperienced persons are advised to remain on open ski runs and trails.',
            'DANGER_LEVEL_2': 'Alarm signs can occur in isolated cases. Avalanches can be triggered in particular on very steep slopes with the aspect and elevation indicated on avalanche.report. Large natural avalanches are unlikely. Backcountry activities should be selected carefully, especially on slopes with the aspect and elevation indicated on avalanche.report. Travel very steep slopes one person at a time. Pay attention to unfavourable snowpack structure (persistent weak layers, old snow problem).',
